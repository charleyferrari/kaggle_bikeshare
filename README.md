Exploratory analysis of the bike share data from Kaggle

This code creates a series of graphs analyzing the behavior of the capital bike share program in Washington DC. I have created several graphs:

1) The count of average daily rides

2) The count of average monthly rides

3) A stacked area graph of monthly rides split between casual and registered users

Then, I create monthly graphs of average daily rides. I look through total count, casual and registered users, along with displaying weekends and holidays (in vertical bars,) weather, temperature, and adjusted temperature (by mapping these variables to the color of the line.)

These graphs are all exported to a PDF, which is also attached to this repository.
